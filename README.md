0x11. C - printf function

This project is about to test the various concepts that myself and Dennis
have been learning at ALX - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COURSE.

This repository will highlight what is needed to have function like printf.

The journey will be challenging but we believe we can do hard things. We are
equal to the task.
